Walking in, it does seem like a throwback to 30 years ago, old fashioned menu board, booths out of the 70s, and a large selection of food. Their speciality is the Italian Hoagie, and it is voted the best in the area year after year. I usually order the burger, while the patties are obviously cooked from frozen, all of the other ingredients are very fresh. Overall, its a good alternative to Subway, which is down the road.", "type": "review", "business_id": "5UmKMjUEUNdYWqANhGckJw"\}\

We have heard that their wings are great and decided it was finally time to check it out. Their wings are whole wings and crispy, which is a nice change of pace. I got their wet Cajun sauce and garlic butter wings. The Cajun did not have a bold enough flavor for me and their sauce is too thin. The sauce was also thin for the garlic butter, but that is more expected. They were better than average, but I don't like seeing all the sauce resting at the bottom of the boat. I would definitely come try this place out again to sample some of the other items on the menu, but this will probably not become a regular stop for wings anytime soon.", "type": "review", "business_id": "UsFtqoBl7naz8AVUBZMjQQ"\}\

Pretty much a lot of butter and some hot sauce (franks red hot maybe).  The whole wings are good size and crispy, but for $1 a wing the sauce could be better.

Joe was very polite and friendly as soon as I met him, as was his shop assistant. I needed a CV joint installed as well as a new transmission mount. Joe was nice enough to estimate a fair price to install both, he honored that price, was fast, very friendly, and treated me like he knew me for years. It's a great neighborhood shop and Joe is a real nice guy who could have easily raked me over the coals, but he didn't. I know quite a bit about cars, and everything he told me was true. He's earned my repeat business immediately. Give him a call, you'll be glad you did. Thanks Joe!", "type": "review", "business_id": "3eu6MEFlq2Dg7bQh8QbdOg"\}\

The mats are pretty solid; however, the grass range needs to be tended too.  It's like hitting out of US Open type rough...not very amenable to practicing.

I don't think I ask much out of a driving range.  Decent mats, clean balls and accessible hours.  Hell you need even less people now with the advent of the machine that doles out the balls.  This place has none of them.  It is april and there are no grass tees yet.  BTW they opened for the season this week although it has been golfing weather for a month.  The mats look like the carpet at my 107 year old aunt Irene's house.  Worn and thread bare.  Let's talk about the hours.  This place is equipped with lights yet they only sell buckets of balls until 730.  It is still light out.  Finally lets you have the pit to hit into.  When I arrived I wasn't sure if this was a driving range or an excavation site for a mastodon or a strip mining operation.  There is no grass on the range. Just mud.  Makes it a good tool to figure out how far you actually are hitting the ball.  Oh, they are cash only also.\\n\\nBottom line, this place sucks.  The best hope is that the owner sells it to someone that actually wants to make money and service golfers in Pittsburgh.", "type": "review", "business_id": "cE27W9VPgO88Qxe4ol6y_g"\}\
